#     ./scripts/load-test.sh --devices 10 --no-simulcast
# Prerequisites: `ffmpeg` on PATH (unless VIDEO is .y4m/.yuv), and an account

# Virtual participants. Each is a real, separate device login.
#
# How many is reasonable depends on how much video encoding this machine can
# do: one encoder per device with SIMULCAST=0 below, two at 640x360 with it on,
# three at 720p. Start low, double, and watch the "frames/10s" health line the
# tool prints every 10 seconds — once it falls below FPS x 10 the generator is
# saturated and further devices add no real load. See "How many devices?" in
# crates/matrix-rtc-livekit/README.md.
DEVICES=3

# Encode cost per device is driven by these three. At 640x360 livekit
# publishes 2 simulcast layers and at 720p it publishes 3, so simulcast is off
# here by default: one encoding per device roughly halves the encode work and
# lets more devices fit on one machine. Set SIMULCAST=1 when the layer
# selection itself is what you want to exercise — a real client publishes with
# it on, and the SFU only has layers to choose between when it is.
#
# SET SIMULCAST=1 WHENEVER A REAL CLIENT IS WATCHING. Element Call (and any
# livekit-client subscriber) uses adaptive stream: it picks a layer from the
# rendered tile size and asks the SFU for it. A publication with no layers to
# choose from resolves to nothing and the SFU forwards no video at all — the
# watcher sees a grey tile, with no decryption errors anywhere, because no
# frames ever arrive. Audio is unaffected, which makes it look like an E2EE
# problem when it is not. Leave it off only for pure scale runs where nobody is
# rendering the participants.

SLOT_ID="m.call#ROOM"

# Publish the m.rtc.slot state event first. Needs the power level for it, and
# is unnecessary when a real client already opened the call.
#
# Set this when the call was opened by Element Call (see ELEMENT_CALL_COMPAT):
# that client publishes no m.rtc.slot at all, and a slot nobody opened reads as
# closed, which projects every member — including these devices — out of the
# call.
OPEN_SLOT=0

# Share the call with Element Call on the JS SDK, which still speaks a MatrixRTC
# wire format from before the 2026 MSC4143 rewrite. One of:
#
#   off     current MSC4143 + MSC4354 only.
#   sticky  the 2025 format. Our membership also carries the fields it needs
#           (notably the device id it addresses media keys to, which it cannot
#           obtain any other way — it runs as a widget and gets no decryption
#           metadata). Media keys then go out under the legacy to-device type
#           INSTEAD of the spec one, since a to-device message has only one
#           type, so a run exchanges keys with Element Call or with
#           spec-current peers, never both.
#   state   the format before MSC4354, where membership is an
#           org.matrix.msc3401.call.member ROOM STATE event, the SFU identity is
#           the plain {user}:{device} string, and the token comes from /sfu/get.
#           Nothing about such a run is visible to a spec-current peer. Set
#           OPEN_SLOT=0 with this: that generation has no slot concept, and the
#           run does not enforce the slot condition at all.
#
# Reading the 2025 format needs no flag and is always on.
ELEMENT_CALL_COMPAT=off

# Accept self-signed certificates (the demo/backend stack).
INSECURE_TLS=0

# How long the homeserver keeps each membership in the sticky map.
#
# Short on purpose (the library default is an hour). A run that is killed rather
# than left cleanly leaves its memberships standing until this elapses — the
# dead man's switch does NOT clear them, because its delayed leave is a plain
# event that never replaces the sticky entry. An hour of ghosts poisons the room
# for the next attempt; two minutes does not.
#
# Costs one extra membership send per device every half of this. Keep it well
# above twice the 15s heartbeat, or memberships lapse between beats.
STICKY_DURATION_MS=120000

# Pacing, to stay under homeserver rate limits.
RAMP_MS=500

# Gap between logins. Every device is a fresh login, and synapse's `rc_login`
# defaults to `per_second: 0.17, burst_count: 3` — three logins immediately,
# then one per ~6 seconds. Exceed that and the homeserver answers 429 "Too many
# login attempts"; the tool waits it out (5 attempts per device with doubling
# backoff), so a run survives, but being throttled is slower than pacing right.
#
# So DEVICES up to 3 works at any pacing, and beyond that you want >= 6000 here:
# 10 devices is then roughly a 50-second ramp. Raise it further if a deployment
# has tightened the limiter. Only a local synapse you control (see demo/backend,
# which sets every rc_* to 1000/1000) can take the old 250ms.
LOGIN_DELAY_MS=7000

# Prefix of the device display names created here, and the one --purge-devices
# matches on.
DEVICE_PREFIX="rtc-loadtest"

# Persist each device's session and crypto store here, and reuse them next run.
# Empty = off (every run logs in fresh devices).
#
# Two reasons to set it:
#   * Logins happen once. A fresh run of DEVICES=10 otherwise spends ~50s being
#     rate-limited through LOGIN_DELAY_MS above; with a store it spends none.
#   * A restored device keeps its megolm sessions, so it can decrypt member
#     events sent BEFORE the run started. A fresh device cannot, which is why a
#     peer already in the call can be invisible until they re-join.
#
# Devices are then kept on exit (logging out would revoke the stored token).
# `--purge-devices` deletes the devices and this folder together.
#
# The folder is created if missing; it need not pre-exist. A folder that already
# has contents and was not created by this tool is refused rather than adopted,
# since a failed restore deletes <store>/device-N inside it.
#
# It holds access tokens and the devices' crypto stores unencrypted, so keep it
# out of the repository and off shared disks — somewhere like
# "$HOME/.matrix-rtc-loadtest" rather than a path under this checkout.
