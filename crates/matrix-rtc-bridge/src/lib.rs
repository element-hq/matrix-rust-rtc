//! Matrix-side bridging for MatrixRTC.
//!
//! [`matrix-rtc-core`] owns *what the protocol says*; a transport crate (e.g.
//! `matrix-rtc-livekit`) owns *how media flows*. This crate owns the third
//! thing: *how the protocol reaches a Matrix homeserver*. It is deliberately
//! transport-free — nothing here knows what a LiveKit SFU is — so a second
//! transport can reuse it unchanged.
//!
//! Three pieces, in increasing order of how much they depend on:
//!
//! - [`compat`] — translation between the current MSC4143 wire format and the
//!   pre-2026 dialects Element Call still speaks. Pure JSON in, pure JSON out;
//!   no Matrix SDK, no async runtime. Available unconditionally.
//! - [`OpenIdTokenSource`] — the host's route to a Matrix OpenID token, which a
//!   transport exchanges for its own credentials. The trait is always available
//!   so a transport can name it; the `matrix_sdk::Client` implementation sits
//!   behind the `matrix-sdk` feature.
//! - [`sdk`] — the SDK-backed bridge proper: [`SdkCommandSender`] carries the
//!   core's outbound commands (memberships, delayed leaves, to-device keys) to a
//!   `matrix_sdk::Client`, and [`run_membership_bridge`] feeds inbound
//!   membership — sticky events and/or room state — back into the core. Behind
//!   the `matrix-sdk` feature.
//!
//! # Why `matrix-sdk` is off by default
//!
//! [`compat`] is the largest and most-tested part of this crate and needs
//! nothing but `serde_json`. Keeping the SDK optional means its tests build in
//! seconds against no git dependencies — which is the whole reason this crate
//! was split out of the LiveKit transport, where every one of them was trapped
//! behind a `libwebrtc` build.
//!
//! # Why sticky events are a second feature
//!
//! `matrix-sdk` alone builds against upstream matrix-rust-sdk, which has no
//! MSC4354 support, so that build carries membership as room state only
//! ([`ElementCallCompat::StateEvents`]). `experimental-sticky` adds the
//! spec-current sticky carrier and needs the fork SDK that implements it; see
//! [`STICKY_EVENTS_SUPPORTED`] and the crate manifest.
//!
//! [`matrix-rtc-core`]: matrix_rtc_core
