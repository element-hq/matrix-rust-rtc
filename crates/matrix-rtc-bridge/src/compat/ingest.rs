//! Raw-event ingestion for hosts, across every MatrixRTC generation.
//!
//! A host binding (uniffi, wasm) cannot feed a legacy membership through the
//! typed sticky ingestion: a pre-2026 content states its transports in a
//! different place, its membership nowhere at all, and a pre-sticky one is not
//! even a sticky event. So raw content crosses the boundary
//! ([`RawMemberEventIn`], [`LegacyStateMemberEventIn`]) and this module does
//! the parsing — once, here, rather than per binding: re-implementing these
//! rules in Kotlin, Swift, *and* JavaScript would be that many copies of the
//! trickiest code in this repository.
//!
//! The dialect translation itself lives in the sibling modules
//! ([`element_call`], [`element_call_state`]) and is shared verbatim with the
//! Rust-native path; this module owns only the host-shaped funnels around it,
//! and the two places a mode changes an identifier rather than a field
//! ([`member_id`], [`outbound_dialect`]).
