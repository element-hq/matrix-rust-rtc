//! Interoperability with MatrixRTC implementations that predate the 2026
//! MSC4143 rewrite.
//!
//! # This module is scaffolding, and is meant to be deleted
//!
//! Everything here exists for one reason: the only other MatrixRTC
//! implementation available to test against — Element Call on the JS SDK — still
//! speaks a pre-2026 wire format. Once it catches up, delete this directory, the
//! call sites listed below, and `matrix_rtc_livekit::CallOptions::element_call_compat`.
//! Nothing else should ever grow a dependency on it.
//!
//! # Two generations, not one
//!
//! There are two, and they disagree about more than field names:
//!
//! - [`element_call`] — Element Call as of 2025. Already MSC4354 sticky-based;
//!   only the fields inside the member content differ.
//! - [`element_call_state`] — Element Call before MSC4354, when membership was
//!   `org.matrix.msc3401.call.member` **room state**. A different carrier, a
//!   different SFU participant identity, and a different token endpoint.
//!
//! [`ElementCallCompat`] selects between them and current MSC4143. It is an enum
//! rather than a pair of flags because the generations are mutually exclusive by
//! construction: a membership is a sticky event or a state event, never both.
//!
//! # Why it is shaped this way
//!
//! The rest of the stack speaks current MSC4143 and nothing else — no dialect
//! parameter reaches `matrix-rtc-core`, no legacy field appears in a domain
//! type. Compatibility is confined to JSON funnels at the very edge:
//!
//! - **Inbound for the sticky dialect**
//!   ([`element_call::normalize_member_content`],
//!   [`element_call::parse_key_message`]) is *permissive and always on*. Every
//!   rule is of the form "the modern field is absent and the legacy one is
//!   present", so a spec-shaped event passes through byte-identical and no flag
//!   is needed to protect it. Being always on is deliberate: a legacy path that
//!   only compiles under a flag is a legacy path that rots.
//! - **Everything about the state dialect** is *opt-in*, in both directions.
//!   Reading it is not normalisation — it is a second membership source, in a
//!   different part of the room, with a lifetime the content states rather than
//!   the homeserver enforcing. See [`element_call_state`] for why that cannot be
//!   always-on the way its sibling is.
//! - **Outbound** ([`OutboundDialect`]) is opt-in for both, because it is the
//!   half that changes what other clients see.
//!
//! # What this module cannot own
//!
//! Three things about the state dialect refuse to be JSON, and are named here so
//! the boundary stays deliberate rather than eroding: the choice of ruma request
//! type (a membership is `PUT .../state/...` rather than a sticky send), the
//! choice of token endpoint, and the participant-identity derivation. Each is one
//! `match` on [`ElementCallCompat`] or [`OutboundDialect`] at the call site.
//! [`MemberEventRoute`] exists precisely to keep the *decision* here while the
//! *performing* stays in the `sdk` module.
//!
//! The identity derivation is the one that also refuses to be *Matrix*: it
//! hashes per MSC4195, which is a LiveKit document. So it lives wholly in the
//! transport crate — `matrix_rtc_livekit::identity_mapper` matches on
//! [`ElementCallCompat`] there rather than this module reaching for a hash it has
//! no business knowing.
//!
//! # Call sites
//!
//! In this crate:
//!
//! 1. `sdk::snapshot` — normalises inbound `m.rtc.member` content.
//! 2. `sdk::SdkCommandSender` — routes and rewrites outbound events.
//! 3. `sdk::element_call_state_snapshot` — reads inbound state membership.
//! 4. `sdk::run_membership_bridge` — the room-state wake source a state-carried
//!    membership needs.
//!
//! In `matrix-rtc-livekit`:
//!
//! 5. `call::register_legacy_key_receiver` — ingests legacy to-device keys.
//! 6. `call::Call::join` — mode selection and the member id.
//! 7. `identity_mapper` — the participant-identity derivation (see above).
//! 8. `transport_impl` + `token` — `/sfu/get`.
//!
//! In `matrix-rtc-ffi`, which reaches the same dialects from a host that owns its
//! own Matrix stack (see that crate's `compat` module):
//!
//! 9. `compat` — the FFI-shaped mode, the raw-JSON ingestion, and the two
//!    identifiers the mode changes.
//! 10. `commands::FfiCommandSender` — routes and rewrites outbound events, per
//!     room.
//! 11. `RtcSessionManagerHandle::{join, leave, set_current_membership,
//!     receive_legacy_encryption_key}` — mode selection, and both inbound halves.
//! 12. `media::session` — the identity derivation and token endpoint again.
