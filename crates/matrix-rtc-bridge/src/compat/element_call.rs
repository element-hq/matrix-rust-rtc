//! The pre-2026 Element Call wire format, translated to and from current
//! MSC4143.
//!
//! Deliberately depends on nothing but `serde_json`: no `matrix-sdk` type, no
//! `matrix-rtc-core` type. Everything is a plain JSON-in/JSON-out function, so
//! the whole dialect is unit-testable without a homeserver and deleting it
//! cannot break a signature anywhere else.
//!
//! # The format, field by field
//!
//! | | Element Call today | MSC4143 today |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | member | `{user_id, device_id, id}` | `{id, membership}` |
//! | leave | content is `{msc4354_sticky_key}` alone | full content, `membership: "leave"` + `leave_reason` |
//! | transports | flat `rtc_transports` array | `transports.{published,can_subscribe}` |
//! | extras | `versions`, `m.relation` | gone from the spec |
//! | key type | `io.element.call.encryption_keys` | `m.rtc.encryption_key` |
//! | key content | `{keys, member, room_id, session, sent_ts}` | `{room_id, member_id, media_key, format}` |
//!
//! # The device id, and why it is load-bearing here
//!
//! Element Call runs as a widget, and the widget API gives it no access to
//! decryption metadata. It therefore cannot learn the device that sent a member
//! event, which is where MSC4143 (since the 2026 rewrite) says a member's device
//! comes from. Two consequences shape this module:
//!
//! - It cannot address a to-device key to us unless our member event *states*
//!   our device, so [`ElementCallDialect::rewrite_member_content`] puts
//!   `member.user_id` / `member.device_id` back on the wire. Without them,
//!   Element Call has no way to send us its media key and its media never
//!   decrypts for us.
//! - Its own member events carry the same self-asserted `member.device_id`.
//!   Where we cannot do better — a member event that reached us unencrypted —
//!   [`claimed_device_id`] surfaces it so the core has *some* device to bind the
//!   member to. That claim is never preferred over an authenticated device; see
//!   `sdk::snapshot`.

// `std::time::SystemTime::now()` panics on wasm32-unknown-unknown; web-time's
// is the same API over `Date.now()`.
