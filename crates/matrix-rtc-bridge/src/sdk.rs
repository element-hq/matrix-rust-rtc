//! Glue between `matrix-rtc-core` and a `matrix_sdk::Client`.
//!
//! This is what makes the Rust stack a first-class MatrixRTC participant against
//! a real homeserver:
//!
//! - [`SdkCommandSender`] implements [`RtcCommandSender`], turning the core's
//!   outbound commands (join/leave member events, dead man's switch delayed
//!   events) into Matrix Client-Server requests.
//! - [`run_membership_bridge`] feeds the room's live membership into an
//!   [`RtcSessionManager`], so the core discovers every peer's `m.rtc.member`
//!   membership.
//!
//! Requires the `matrix-sdk` feature. Membership has two carriers, and which
//! this build can read and write is a compile-time fact:
//!
//! - MSC4354 **sticky events**, the spec-current carrier, need the
//!   `experimental-sticky` feature and the fork SDK behind it. Without it the
//!   sticky send arm returns an error and the bridge reads no sticky map.
//! - `org.matrix.msc3401.call.member` **room state**, the pre-sticky Element
//!   Call carrier ([`crate::compat::ElementCallCompat::StateEvents`]), works
//!   against the stock SDK and is the only carrier a default build has.
//!
//! [`STICKY_EVENTS_SUPPORTED`] says which build this is, so a caller can refuse
//! a mode it cannot serve instead of joining a call nobody can see.

// The sticky duration for `m.rtc.member` now comes from the core
// (`JoinSessionParams::sticky_duration_ms`), which re-sends the membership at
// half that interval to stay in the map. It used to be a constant here, which
// meant nothing knew when the entry would lapse.
//
// NOTE: the delayed leave is a plain (non-sticky) delayed event, so it clears
// nothing from the sticky map when it fires — crash cleanup relies entirely on
// the membership's own sticky TTL expiring. That makes the dead man's switch
// ceremonial today, and it is why a crashed client lingers as a ghost for up to
// `sticky_duration_ms` rather than `keep_alive_timeout_ms`.
//
// It is *not* an HTTP-level limitation. MSC4140 has no endpoint of its own: both
// `org.matrix.msc4140.delay` and `org.matrix.msc4354.sticky_duration_ms` are
// query parameters on the ordinary
// `PUT /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{room}/send/{type}/{txn}`, so a sticky delayed
// event is just both at once. The blocker is ruma's types —
// `delayed_message_event::Request` has no sticky field and
// `send_message_event::Request` has no delay field, so neither can express both.
//
// Two things to settle upstream before relying on it:
//   * Neither MSC states that the two compose (MSC4354 only hints: they "may be
//     combined ... to provide heartbeat semantics (e.g required for MatrixRTC)").
//   * `origin_server_ts` for a delayed event must be the *fire* time, not the
//     scheduling time. MSC4354 resolves sticky conflicts by highest
//     `origin_server_ts + duration` ("last to expire wins"), so a leave stamped
//     at scheduling time would expire *before* the join it is meant to replace
//     and would never take effect. MSC4140 only implies fire time, in a footnote
//     about event IDs.
