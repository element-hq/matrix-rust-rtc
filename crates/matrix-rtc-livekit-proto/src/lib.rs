//! The pure half of the MSC4195 LiveKit control plane.
//!
//! Everything a MatrixRTC client must *compute* to reach a LiveKit SFU, with
//! none of the IO: the hash derivations ([`identity`]), the authorisation
//! service's request/response shapes ([`token`]), and the per-generation
//! dialect choices ([`TokenEndpoint`], [`identity_mapper`]). The native
//! transport (`matrix-rtc-livekit`, which owns libwebrtc and reqwest) builds on
//! this; so does the web binding, where the browser does the fetching and
//! livekit-js does the media — which is why this crate must stay free of
//! `livekit`, HTTP clients, and async runtimes, and compile for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

/// One of the two things the bridge's `compat` deliberately cannot own — the
/// other being [`TokenEndpoint`] — because the modern derivation hashes per
/// MSC4195, which is a LiveKit document rather than a Matrix wire format. The
/// `compat` module decides *which generation*; this decides *what that means
/// for an identity*.
///
/// Call it once per call and share the returned `Arc`: it has four uses (the
/// core's encryption manager, the media transport, our own identity, and the
/// key ring — see `matrix-rtc-livekit`'s `call::Call::join`), and they must not
/// skew. That matters more than it looks, because a divergence is not an error
/// but a silence: peers appear in the roster with no media, their keys land
/// under an identity the SFU never assigned, and nothing anywhere logs a
/// problem.
///
/// This is deliberately a plain Rust closure even on the web:
/// `RtcIdentityMapper` is `Send + Sync`, which a JS-backed function can never
/// be, and the derivation is a hash with no reason to cross the boundary.
