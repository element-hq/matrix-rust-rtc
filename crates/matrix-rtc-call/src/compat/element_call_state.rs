//! The Element Call membership format from *before* MSC4354: MatrixRTC
//! membership as `org.matrix.msc3401.call.member` **room state**.
//!
//! One generation older than [`super::element_call`], which handles the sticky
//! dialect. Both are Element Call; the difference is where the membership
//! lives. A deployment speaks one or the other, never both, so the two files
//! barely interact and either can be deleted without touching the other.
//!
//! Depends on nothing but `serde_json`, for the same reasons as its sibling: the
//! whole translation is unit-testable against captured payloads, and deleting it
//! cannot break a signature anywhere else.
//!
//! # Why this one is opt-in in *both* directions
//!
//! Reading the sticky dialect needs no flag because every rule there is "the
//! modern field is absent and the legacy one is present" — a spec-shaped event
//! comes out byte-identical, so there is nothing a flag would protect. Nothing
//! about this module is like that. It reads a *different event type*, in a
//! *different part of the room*, with a lifetime the content states rather than
//! the homeserver enforcing. Left on everywhere, any room that ever hosted an
//! old Element Call — which is most rooms that ever hosted one at all — would
//! show a call that ended months ago.
//!
//! And unlike the sticky dialect, the outbound half cannot be additive. That one
//! adds legacy fields beside the spec ones so a single event serves both
//! readers. Here the membership is not a timeline event at all, our SFU identity
//! is derived differently, and the token comes from a different endpoint. A call
//! joined this way is visible to this generation of Element Call and to nobody
//! else, which is why it lives behind
//! [`ElementCallCompat::StateEvents`](super::ElementCallCompat::StateEvents).
//!
//! # The format, field by field
//!
//! State key `_{user}_{device}_{application}{call_id}`, e.g.
//! `_@alice:example.io_V5cP8FErcB_m.call`. Inbound it is **not parsed**:
//! everything it encodes is also in the content or in the event's own
//! homeserver-stamped `sender`, and the grammar has two legal spellings (with
//! and without the leading underscore). Trusting the content and the `sender`
//! avoids the question entirely.
//!
//! | | Element Call, pre-sticky | MSC4143 today |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | carrier | `org.matrix.msc3401.call.member` state event | `m.rtc.member` sticky event |
//! | session | `application: "m.call"` (a string) + `call_id` + `scope` | `slot_id: "m.call#ROOM"` |
//! | member id | `membershipID` | `member.id` (== the sticky key) |
//! | device | `device_id` in the content, self-asserted | the device that encrypted the event |
//! | join | any non-empty content | `member.membership: "join"` |
//! | leave | content becomes `{}` | `membership: "leave"` + `leave_reason` |
//! | lifetime | `created_ts + expires`, checked by every reader | the homeserver's sticky TTL |
//! | transport | `foci_preferred` + `focus_active.focus_selection` | `transports.{published,can_subscribe}` |
//! | SFU identity | the plain `membershipID` string | `base64(SHA256([user, device, member_id]))` |
//!
//! # Two things the translation has to resolve, because nothing downstream can
//!
//! **Expiry.** A sticky entry lapses at the homeserver and simply stops being
//! reported, so the core has no expiry logic at all — nowhere to put a deadline
//! and no timer to fire it. Here the deadline is in the content, so an expired
//! membership has to be dropped *here* or it becomes a permanent ghost. The
//! deadline is `created_ts + expires`, falling back to the event's
//! `origin_server_ts` when the content states no `created_ts` — which is exactly
//! the first join of a session, where the client cannot know the timestamp yet.
//! Ruma reads it the same way (`MembershipData::expires_ts`).
//!
//! **The active focus.** `focus_active.focus_selection: "oldest_membership"`
//! means every member uses the *oldest* member's first preferred focus, so which
//! SFU a peer is on is a property of the room's whole membership rather than of
//! that peer's own event. The core has no such concept and must not grow one —
//! the MSC4195 model is that a membership names its own transports — so the
//! cross-member resolution happens here and each translated membership comes out
//! already naming the one transport it actually publishes on. Getting this wrong
//! is silent: we connect to a different SFU and hear nobody.
//!
//! # Not handled: the `memberships` array
//!
//! The original MSC3401 content was one state event per *user* holding an array
//! of per-device memberships (ruma's `LegacyMembershipContent`). That is two
//! generations back, not one, and no deployment we test against still writes it.
//! Such a content is dropped with a log line rather than half-supported.
//!
//! # Why not ruma's `CallMemberEventContent`
//!
//! It exists (`unstable-msc3401` is on) and it is the wrong tool. It is
//! `#[serde(untagged)]` over three shapes, and the one that matches this format,
//! `SessionMembershipData`, has **no `membershipID` field** — so the member id
//! the entire roster and every media key hangs on would be silently dropped. It
//! also makes `expires`, `foci_preferred` and `focus_active` required, so a
//! content missing any of them fails the whole parse instead of degrading. Raw
//! JSON is both more permissive and more honest here.
