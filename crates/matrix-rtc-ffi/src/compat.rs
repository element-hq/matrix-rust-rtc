//! Pre-2026 Element Call interoperability, exposed to FFI hosts.
//!
//! The translation itself lives in [`matrix_rtc_bridge::compat`] and its
//! host-agnostic funnels in [`matrix_rtc_bridge::compat::ingest`], shared with
//! the wasm binding and the Rust-native path; nothing here re-implements a
//! dialect. What this module owns is the *uniffi* binding: an FFI-shaped mode
//! enum and the JSON-string record shapes uniffi can carry.
//!
//! # Why the host cannot do this itself
//!
//! [`crate::StickyEvent`] is a typed record: the host parses an `m.rtc.member`
//! content and hands over the fields. That works for a spec-current peer and
//! cannot work for a legacy one — a pre-2026 content states its transports in a
//! different place, its membership nowhere at all, and a pre-sticky one is not
//! even a sticky event. Re-implementing those rules in Kotlin and Swift would be
//! more copies of the trickiest code in this repository, so the raw content
//! crosses the boundary instead ([`RawMemberEvent`],
//! [`LegacyStateMemberEvent`]) and Rust does the parsing.
//!
//! # What a host must do differently in each mode
//!
//! - [`FfiElementCallCompat::Off`] — nothing. The existing typed ingestion and
//!   `m.rtc.member` sends are exactly right.
//! - [`FfiElementCallCompat::StickyEvents`] — feed membership through
//!   [`RtcSessionManagerHandle::set_current_membership`], and feed
//!   `io.element.call.encryption_keys` to-device messages through
//!   [`RtcSessionManagerHandle::receive_legacy_encryption_key`]. Both are needed
//!   to *read* that generation; the outbound half needs no host change.
//! - [`FfiElementCallCompat::StateEvents`] — the above, plus: pass the room's
//!   `org.matrix.msc3401.call.member` **state** as the second argument of
//!   `set_current_membership`, and implement
//!   [`CommandSenderCallback::send_delayed_state_event`](crate::CommandSenderCallback::send_delayed_state_event).
//!
//! Slots need no host handling in any mode. That generation predates
//! `m.rtc.slot`, so its rooms contain none and the truthful "no slots" a host
//! feeds would resolve the session closed and project out every member, us
//! included. Joining in [`FfiElementCallCompat::StateEvents`] forgets whatever
//! slot state was already supplied for the room (slot state usually arrives with
//! sync, before the user joins) and
//! [`RtcSessionManagerHandle::on_room_slots_received`] ignores later updates for
//! it, leaving the open-slot condition unenforced — "unknowable", which is the
//! honest answer, rather than "closed".
//!
//! The 2025 dialect is different, and deliberately: those rooms are otherwise
//! spec-shaped, a slot in one is meaningful, and the condition stays enforced. In
//! practice Element Call of that vintage publishes no `m.rtc.slot` either, so a
//! host that feeds slot state needs someone to open the slot — the native tools
//! do it themselves (`--open-slot`). A host that never calls
//! [`RtcSessionManagerHandle::on_room_slots_received`] at all is unaffected: the
//! condition is unenforced until it does.
//!
//! [`RtcSessionManagerHandle::set_current_membership`]: crate::RtcSessionManagerHandle::set_current_membership
//! [`RtcSessionManagerHandle::receive_legacy_encryption_key`]: crate::RtcSessionManagerHandle::receive_legacy_encryption_key
//! [`RtcSessionManagerHandle::on_room_slots_received`]: crate::RtcSessionManagerHandle::on_room_slots_received
