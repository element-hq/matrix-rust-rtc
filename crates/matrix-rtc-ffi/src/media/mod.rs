//! Media over the FFI: participants with observable frame streams.
//!
//! Behind the `media` cargo feature (default **off**: it pulls the LiveKit
//! client and therefore libwebrtc — roughly 8–15 MB per ABI). The slim
//! signalling-only artifact stays available without it.
//!
//! The shape mirrors the native `Call` facade, adapted to an FFI host that
//! owns its own Matrix stack:
//!
//! 1. The host drives the [`RtcSessionManagerHandle`](crate::RtcSessionManagerHandle)
//!    exactly as before (sticky events in, commands out) and `join`s the slot.
//! 2. [`connect_media_session`] then attaches media: it wires the E2EE key
//!    bridge into the core, starts the transport-agnostic `CallEngine`
//!    (which opens connections to every peer's focus — MSC4195 multi-SFU),
//!    and connects the own-focus SFU with per-participant frame encryption.
//!    It reads the `member.id` from that join rather than taking one from the
//!    host — our MSC4195 participant identity is derived from it, so the two
//!    must not be able to disagree.
//! 3. The host consumes [`MediaSession`]: the unified event stream
//!    (`next_event`, bridged to Kotlin `Flow` / Swift `AsyncStream`), the
//!    participant roster, per-stream constraints, frame streams
//!    (audio by value; video as objects with both safe copies and zero-copy
//!    plane pointers), and local publications it pushes captured frames into.
//! 4. Keys: outbound distribution already flows through the host's
//!    [`CommandSenderCallback`](crate::CommandSenderCallback)
//!    (`sendToDeviceMessage`); inbound, the host feeds decrypted
//!    `m.rtc.encryption_key` to-device messages to
//!    [`RtcSessionManagerHandle::receive_encryption_key`](crate::RtcSessionManagerHandle::receive_encryption_key).
//!
//! Everything media runs on a dedicated multithreaded tokio runtime
//! ([`runtime`]); the manager's `?Send` futures never touch it.
