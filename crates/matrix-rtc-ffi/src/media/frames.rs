//! Frames across the FFI boundary.
//!
//! The delivery model (per-platform decision made with the SDK owner):
//!
//! - **Streams are async-pull**: objects with `async fn next()`, which
//!   Kotlin bridges to a `Flow` and Swift to an `AsyncStream`. Frame
//!   delivery is latest-frame-wins upstream, so a slow consumer drops
//!   frames instead of buffering.
//! - **Audio frames go by value** ([`FfiAudioFrame`], ~2 KB at 10 ms/48 kHz
//!   mono — the copy is noise at 100 calls/s), as little-endian bytes rather
//!   than a sample list: uniffi maps `Vec<u8>` to a `ByteArray`/`Data`, whereas
//!   a `Vec<i16>` becomes a boxed `List<Short>` — roughly 48 000 boxed objects a
//!   second at 48 kHz mono, which was the single biggest cost this API imposed
//!   on a host.
//! - **Video frames are objects** ([`VideoFrameRef`]) whose default read path
//!   is the zero-copy one: `plane_ptr` + `stride`, valid for as long as the
//!   object is referenced (lifetime is the object, not a manual handle) and
//!   readable and releasable from any thread. `data(plane)` returns a copy
//!   for hosts that cannot take a pointer, and is the slow path — at frame
//!   sizes the copies, and the garbage they make, cost more than the codec.
//! - **Capture goes the other way by value**: the host pushes PCM/I420 into
//!   a [`FfiLocalTrack`].
