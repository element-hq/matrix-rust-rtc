//! Android-only linker adjustments for this crate's `cdylib`: a build ID so
//! crashes can be symbolicated, and the JNI symbol export the static
//! `libwebrtc` that `livekit` pulls in needs to be reachable from Java.
//!
//! ## The JNI symbols
//!
//! libwebrtc's Java classes (`livekit.org.webrtc.*`, shipped in the bundled
//! `libwebrtc.jar`) are backed by `Java_livekit_org_webrtc_*` native methods
//! inside `libwebrtc.a`. Nothing in Rust references them, so the linker
//! dead-strips those archive members and the resulting `.so` exports zero
//! `Java_*` symbols. At runtime the very first Java→C++ call then fails with
//! "No implementation found for ..." — and because it happens inside
//! `PeerConnectionFactory` construction (`DefaultVideoEncoderFactory`, which
//! `RtcRuntime()` builds unconditionally), *no* session can be created, not
//! even audio-only. Worse, libwebrtc's JNI helpers call `NewStringUTF` without
//! an `ExceptionCheck`, so ART turns the pending exception into a SIGABRT
//! rather than an error we could surface.
//!
//! `webrtc_sys_build::configure_jni_symbols()` already fixes exactly this: it
//! reads the `Java_livekit_org_webrtc*` symbols out of `libwebrtc.a` and emits
//! a `-Wl,--undefined=` for each (so the members are pulled in) plus a
//! `--version-script` keeping them exported. `webrtc-sys`'s own build script
//! calls it — but it emits `cargo:rustc-link-arg`, and those apply only to the
//! *emitting* package's linked targets. `webrtc-sys` is an rlib, so nothing is
//! linked there and the flags are silently dropped on the way to our cdylib.
//! Only the crate that owns the cdylib can inject them, hence this file.
//!
//! This is the Android half of the same class of bug that
//! `matrix-rtc-livekit/build.rs` fixes with `-ObjC` for Apple targets. That one
//! lives in the livekit crate because it targets examples/tests; this one has
//! to live here because the artifact it fixes is *our* `cdylib`.

/// Not on by default anywhere in this pipeline: lld writes no
/// `.note.gnu.build-id` unless asked, and `cargo-ndk` strips the copy it places
/// in `jniLibs`. That leaves the shipped library with no symbols and the
/// unstripped one under `target/` with no identity, so nothing can establish
/// that a given `.so` produced a given crash — and `ndk-stack` pointed at a
/// mismatched build prints confident, wrong function names rather than failing.
/// `llvm-strip` preserves the note, so stamping it here puts the same ID on
/// both halves: a tombstone reports the shipped library's `BuildId:`, and that
/// string identifies which `target/` artifact to symbolicate against.
