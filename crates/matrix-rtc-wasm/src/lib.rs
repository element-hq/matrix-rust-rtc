//! WebAssembly bindings for the MatrixRTC core.
//!
//! This layer accepts JS-shaped sticky events and maps them into core DTOs.
//! Keeping this conversion here lets the core remain independent from wasm/JS types.
//!
//! # Only built for `wasm32`
//!
//! The crate body is `cfg`-gated to `wasm32` because it cannot compile anywhere
//! else: its futures wrap JS promises and are therefore `!Send`, while
//! `matrix-rtc-core`'s command traits are `Send` on every target *but* wasm32
//! (see [`matrix_rtc_core::RtcCommandSender`]). On other targets this compiles
//! to an empty crate so a workspace-wide `cargo check`/`clippy` still passes.
//!
//! The consequence is that a host-target build no longer type-checks this crate.
//! Check it explicitly:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo check -p matrix-rtc-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
//! ```
