//! The call engine: one flat participant roster over N transport connections.
//!
//! The engine consumes the core's membership snapshots (the signalling truth
//! about who is in the call) and the call layer's raised hands and reactions,
//! and reconciles them with the media of a [`MediaPool`] — which owns the
//! MSC4195 connections and maps transport identities back to `member_id`s —
//! into the [`Participant`] roster, the tiles and the unified [`CallEvent`]
//! stream.
//!
//! The pool is driven from the engine's actor rather than running beside it,
//! so a member's join always lands on the roster before their media does, and
//! the roster and the event stream never disagree about it. Only the *own*
//! focus ending (adopted via [`CallEngine::adopt_own_connection`]) ends the
//! call; a peer focus is the pool's to reconnect.
//!
//! The roster is the whole call; joins, leaves, hands and reactions on the
//! event stream are only the changes made while we are in it, so the roster
//! we arrive to, and the hands already up in it, are never announced.
