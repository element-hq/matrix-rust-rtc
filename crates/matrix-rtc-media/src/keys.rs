//! Bridge from `matrix-rtc-core` key signals towards a transport's frame
//! encryption.
//!
//! `matrix-rtc-core` produces per-participant media keys and hands them to the
//! application via [`EncryptionKeySignalHandler::on_new_key_material`]. The
//! eventual destination is the transport's frame-encryption key ring — LiveKit
//! native's `KeyProvider`, livekit-js's `ExternalE2EEKeyProvider` on the web —
//! keyed by the participant's transport identity and the key index. The ring is
//! behind [`FrameKeyRing`], which is all a transport implements; everything
//! else here is transport-neutral bookkeeping: recording, the ring-size guard,
//! the rejected-key rule, the local sender's index switch, and listener
//! fan-out.
//!
//! A handler created via [`MediaKeyHandler::with_ring`] imports signalled keys
//! into the ring; one created via [`MediaKeyHandler::new`] only records them.
//!
//! This handler also owns the MSC4143 `delayBeforeUse` wait. `matrix-rtc-core`
//! deliberately holds no timer — it only states the delay, as
//! [`KeyMaterialSignal::use_after_ms`] — so that a synchronous FFI host can
//! drive it from a plain thread. Enforcing it is therefore a transport-layer
//! obligation, and this is the one implementation of it.
