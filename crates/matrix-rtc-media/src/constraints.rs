//! Per-participant, per-stream subscription constraints.
//!
//! Applications describe *how they consume* a stream — is it rendered, at
//! what size, under what bandwidth budget — and transports translate the
//! resolved form into their own control surface. The declarative shape is
//! deliberately transport-free so a P2P or WebTransport backend can interpret
//! the same values with its own signalling.
//!
//! The [`CallEngine`](crate::engine::CallEngine) stores constraints and hands
//! transports only the folded [`ResolvedConstraints`]; transports interpret,
//! they never police. Whatever is asked for is a *cap*: transports and
//! servers still adapt downwards under congestion on their own.
//!
//! Two design points, learned from how SFUs actually behave:
//!
//! - **Not rendering has two strengths.** A stream that is merely
//!   off-screen ([`MediaConstraints::visible`] `= false`) is *paused* —
//!   still subscribed, no data flowing, resumes instantly when scrolled
//!   back. A stream the app does not want at all
//!   ([`MediaConstraints::enabled`] `= false`) may be released as fully as
//!   the transport supports — ideally unsubscribed (bandwidth **and**
//!   decoder freed, resume renegotiates), at minimum paused. The
//!   distinction is in the model so transports can honour it; large calls
//!   need it — a 20-tile grid cannot hold 20 warm video decoders on a
//!   phone.
//! - **Size beats quality as a hint.** The renderer knows its surface size
//!   in pixels; it does not know the publisher's simulcast layer ladder.
//!   [`VideoDetail::Dimensions`] lets the server pick the closest layer and
//!   is the preferred control (LiveKit has deprecated the quality field in
//!   its wire protocol in favour of dimensions). The two are mutually
//!   exclusive by construction.
