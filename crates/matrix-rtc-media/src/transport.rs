//! The contract a media transport implements.
//!
//! A transport (LiveKit SFU today; P2P or WebTransport pub/sub later) knows
//! how to reach the media a member advertises in the `transports.published`
//! field of their `m.rtc.member` event, and how to map between MatrixRTC
//! memberships and its own participant identities.
//!
//! Members whose [`MediaTransport::connection_key`] is equal share one
//! [`TransportConnection`] — for LiveKit that key is the
//! `livekit_service_url`, matching MSC4195's rule that members on the same
//! focus share a room while every other focus needs its own subscribe-side
//! connection.
//!
//! Everything here is `Send + Sync` off `wasm32`, where transports must never
//! require the engine's tasks to be pinned to a `LocalSet`. On `wasm32` the
//! bounds vanish ([`MaybeSend`]): a browser transport wraps livekit-js through
//! `JsValue`s, which are `!Send`, and the engine runs on the JS event loop.
