//! High-level "join a call" facade over the whole stack.
//!
//! [`Call::join`] wires together everything a MatrixRTC participant needs —
//! the [`RtcSessionManager`] with an SDK-backed command sender, the sticky
//! membership bridge, MSC4143 media-key signalling in both directions, the
//! MSC4195 token exchange, and an E2EE-enabled SFU connection driven through
//! the transport-agnostic [`matrix_rtc_media`] layer. [`Call::leave`] tears
//! all of it down in the right order.
//!
//! Consume the call through the unified stream
//! ([`Call::subscribe_call_events`]) and the [`Call::participants`] roster;
//! the raw LiveKit accessors ([`Call::events`], [`Call::session`]) remain for
//! the transition and will go away once frame streams cover their uses.
//!
//! Requires the `matrix-sdk` feature.
//!
//! # Runtime requirements
//!
//! The core's command sender is `?Send`, so the futures driving the session
//! are `!Send`: **[`Call::join`] must be called from within a
//! [`tokio::task::LocalSet`]** (it uses `spawn_local` internally) and panics
//! outside one. See `examples/join_and_record.rs` for the runtime skeleton.
//!
//! # Preconditions
//!
//! - the client is logged in and syncing (e.g. `matrix_sdk_ui::sync_service::SyncService`
//!   is running — under `unstable-msc4354` it auto-enables the sticky-events
//!   extension the membership bridge relies on);
//! - the user has joined `room`;
//! - the slot is open (an `m.rtc.slot` state event; see [`open_slot`]) —
//!   MSC4143 counts nobody as joined against a closed slot.
