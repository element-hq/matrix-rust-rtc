//! Load generator: log in N devices of one account, join them all to the same
//! MatrixRTC call, and have each publish a video file as its camera track.
//!
//! Meant to be run while a human watches the same call in Element Web and
//! inspects SFU/homeserver/client performance. The tool measures nothing about
//! the deployment itself — it only reports its own health (frames actually
//! captured per device), so a machine that ran out of CPU is not mistaken for a
//! server that fell over.
//!
//! N devices of one user is equivalent to N users here: membership is keyed on
//! a random per-join `member_id`, the SFU identity hashes `(user, device,
//! member_id)`, and the core sends media keys to other devices of our own user
//! like any other peer. Each virtual participant is a **real, separate login** —
//! reusing one device id would make the participations shadow each other.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --release -p matrix-rtc-livekit --example load_test \
//!     --features matrix-sdk -- \
//!     --user loadtest --room '!room:synapse' --video clip.mp4 --devices 5
//! ```
//!
//! Needs `ffmpeg` on `PATH` unless the input is already `.y4m` or raw `.yuv`.
//!
//! **Cross-signing is mandatory.** A run that logs in fresh devices needs them
//! cross-signed, because MSC4153 (enforced by the core, and by the SDK's
//! identity-based to-device strategy) only lets cross-signed devices exchange
//! media keys. Pass the account's recovery key; the first run of
//! `join_and_record` against a fresh account prints one.
//!
//! Devices are deleted on exit. If the process is killed hard, `--purge-devices`
//! removes whatever it left behind.
//!
//! `--store <folder>` changes both of those: devices and their crypto stores
//! persist between runs, so logins (and the rate limiting that comes with them)
//! happen once, and a restored device can still decrypt member events sent
//! before the run began. Devices are then kept on exit, and `--purge-devices`
//! clears the folder along with them.
