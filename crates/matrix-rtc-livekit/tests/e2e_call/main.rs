//! Two-client end-to-end MatrixRTC call over LiveKit, driven entirely by the
//! Rust stack (no browser, no microphone).
//!
//! The flow mirrors a real call being set up from scratch:
//!
//! 1. Two throwaway users are provisioned on the homeserver (unless
//!    `ALICE`/`BOB` credentials are supplied), log in and start a sync service.
//! 2. `alice` **creates an encrypted room**, sets history visibility to
//!    `shared`, and **invites** `bob`.
//! 3. `bob` **joins** the room; both sides wait until the two-member room
//!    membership has settled.
//! 4. `alice` **opens the slot** with an `m.rtc.slot` state event; MSC4143
//!    only counts members as joined against an open slot.
//! 5. Only then do both peers join the call through the [`Call`] facade, which
//!    publishes each side's `m.rtc.member` membership as an MSC4354 sticky
//!    event (plus a dead man's switch delayed leave), exchanges media keys,
//!    and connects to the SFU with frame E2EE.
//! 6. `alice` publishes a 440 Hz tone and `bob` records what the SFU forwards
//!    and verifies the frequency.
//!
//! Three scenarios share this flow: `e2e_call_two_clients_audio` (both on one
//! SFU, verified over the raw LiveKit event stream), `e2e_call_two_clients_two_foci`
//! (each participant on their own SFU — MSC4195 multi-SFU — with tones in both
//! directions verified through the transport-agnostic media API), and
//! `e2e_call_rejoin_in_the_same_process` (one peer hangs up and calls again
//! while the other stays, so the incumbent has to re-key the new participation).
//!
//! Runs against the `demo/backend` stack (see its README) with no further
//! configuration — every endpoint defaults to the stack's localhost ports and
//! users are created on the fly:
//!
//! ```sh
//! make backend-up
//! cargo test -p matrix-rtc-livekit --features matrix-sdk,testing \
//!     --test e2e_call -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
