//! Element Call reactions and the raised hand.
//!
//! Neither is in the spec. Both are ordinary room events that *relate to the
//! reacting member's own membership event*, which is how a receiver ties a
//! reaction to a participant tile without trusting anything in the content:
//!
//! - An emoji reaction is an `io.element.call.reaction` event with an
//!   `m.reference` relation to the sender's `m.rtc.member` event, plus `emoji`
//!   and `name`. It is transient: Element Call shows it for three seconds and
//!   ignores further reactions from the same member while one is showing. The
//!   `name` selects a sound; an unknown name plays a generic one.
//! - A raised hand is a plain `m.reaction` annotation of the membership event
//!   with key [`RAISED_HAND_KEY`]. There is no "lowered" event: the annotation
//!   is redacted instead.
//!
//! Only the *protocol* lives here — building and validating the events, the
//! anti-spam window, the raised-hand set — and it is host-agnostic on purpose:
//! playing a sound and hiding an emoji after three seconds are the host's,
//! which is why a received reaction carries a sound *hint* rather than audio.
//!
//! # The membership event id moves
//!
//! A sticky membership is re-sent before it expires, and the new event replaces
//! the old one in the sticky map; matrix-js-sdk's `CallMembership.eventId`
//! follows it. Element Call then drops a raised hand whose membership event has
//! moved on and re-queries the relations of the *new* event. Two consequences:
//!
//! - Our own raised hand is re-annotated onto the new membership event after
//!   every refresh (and the old annotation redacted), or Element Call peers
//!   would lower it for us. See [`crate::RtcSession::heartbeat`].
//! - As a receiver we are more lenient than Element Call: a hand stays raised
//!   for as long as the member is in the call, whichever of their membership
//!   events it was annotated on. A member's reaction is validated against every
//!   membership event id the session has seen for them, not only the latest.
