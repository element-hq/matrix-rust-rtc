//! Encryption manager for Matrix RTC sessions.
//!
//! This module provides key management for encrypted RTC sessions, implementing
//! the key distribution architecture described in [MSC4143](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4143).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The encryption manager is responsible for:
//!
//! 1. **Key Generation**: Creating secure random 32-byte keys for media encryption
//! 2. **Key Distribution**: Sending keys to other participants via to-device messages (MSC4143)
//! 3. **Key Storage**: Maintaining inbound keys from other participants
//! 4. **Key Rotation**: Rotating keys when participants join/leave with grace period support
//! 5. **Signaling**: Notifying the application layer when new key material is available
//!
//! # Key Distribution Strategy (MSC4143)
//!
//! A rotation is not free: every member present has to be sent the new key, so
//! the traffic of one is proportional to the size of the call, and a policy that
//! rotates per event is quadratic in a busy one. What the rules below are for is
//! keeping the count down without letting anybody read what they should not.
//!
//! Every key is minted with an **expiry**, and rotating is nothing more than that
//! expiry arriving. Membership changes do not decide to rotate; they bring the
//! expiry forward:
//!
//! | event | effect on the expiry |
//! |---|---|
//! | minted | `creation + max_key_lifetime_ms` |
//! | a member holding it leaves, or their participation changes | `min(expiry, creation + grace)` |
//! | a member arrives and the key is no longer fresh | `now` |
//! | a member arrives and the key is still fresh | none — just send them the key |
//!
//! The departure rule needs no test for whether the key is fresh, which is what
//! makes this one instant rather than several rules: `min(expiry, creation + grace)`
//! lands in the future while the key is fresh (deferring, and coalescing every later
//! change into the same instant) and in the past once it has settled (rotating now).
//! It is idempotent, so a second leaver recomputes the same deadline.
//!
//! The asymmetry between the last two rows is the point. A joiner handed the current
//! key gains the past it has already encrypted, bounded by how old the key is — so
//! while it is young, sharing it is cheap, and a bulk join costs one rotation rather
//! than one per arrival. A leaver keeps the *future* of everything their key goes on
//! encrypting, which grows without end — so their key must always be retired; only
//! *when* is negotiable. An arrival therefore never leaves a rotation owed.
//!
//! Deferring to the end of freshness makes a burst cost two rotations however large
//! it is: the one that minted the key, and the one that expires it. Anchoring that
//! deadline to the key's own age rather than to the last change is what bounds it —
//! a call with a leaver every few seconds would otherwise push it back for ever. It
//! also caps a churning call at one rotation per grace period.
//!
//! The lifetime cap is what a quiet call relies on: without it one key would encrypt
//! a whole meeting, and anything that later recovered it would recover all of them.
//!
//! [`EncryptionManager::flush_due_rotation`] performs a deferred rotation and a
//! consumer has to drive it, because the core owns no timer.
//!
//! Membership changes that arrive *together* are cheaper still: a rollout sees a
//! whole roster, so any number of simultaneous changes cost one rotation between
//! them. Hosts should feed complete state rather than event by event — see
//! `RtcSessionManager::set_current_sticky_state`.
//!
//! `KEY_ROTATION.md` at the repository root states the whole trade, with the costs
//! measured.
//!
//! # Key Usage Delay (MSC4143: delayBeforeUse)
//!
//! A newly distributed key is not necessarily used for encryption at once: the
//! members who hold the outgoing one need `delay_before_use_ms` to install its
//! replacement, and until they have, whatever we stamp with the new key is
//! undecryptable to them.
//!
//! Every rotation therefore waits, including one caused by a departure — which
//! does leave the member who left able to decrypt for up to
//! `delay_before_use_ms` after they are gone. That is a deliberate trade, not an
//! oversight: switching the moment somebody hangs up freezes video for everyone
//! still in the call while the replacement key travels, and a few seconds
//! readable to someone who has already left costs less than a call that stutters
//! whenever the roster moves.
//!
//! Whoever *arrives* at a rotation is handed the outgoing key as well as its
//! replacement. Without it the wait would blind them completely — they hold
//! nothing else — turning every join into an established call into a
//! `delay_before_use_ms` media blackout.
//!
//! Two cases carry no delay at all: the first key, signalled on the first
//! `on_memberships_update()` so the transport is listening, and a rotation whose
//! outgoing key no member present holds.
//!
//! This module does not *wait*, it only says how long to wait: the delay travels
//! to the consumer as [`KeyMaterialSignal::use_after_ms`], and the media layer
//! schedules activation. That keeps the core free of any timer — it holds no
//! reactor dependency at all, which is what lets a synchronous FFI host drive it
//! from a plain thread. Enforcing the delay is therefore a consumer obligation;
//! `matrix-rtc-livekit`'s `MediaKeyBridge` is the reference implementation.
//!
//! # Outdated Key Filtering
//!
//! In scenarios where participants quickly join/leave/join, keys might arrive
//! out of order. The `OutdatedKeyFilter` detects and drops outdated keys to
//! prevent decryption issues. If we receive a key at index N with timestamp T2,
//! then a key at the same index N with timestamp T1 < T2, the older key is dropped.
//!
//! # Integration with Application Layer
//!
//! The encryption manager signals new key material to the application layer via
//! the `EncryptionKeySignalHandler` trait. The application is responsible for:
//!
//! 1. Receiving the raw key bytes
//! 2. Applying key derivation/stretching as needed (e.g., using HKDF)
//! 3. Using the derived keys with the media encryption layer
//!
//! The raw bytes provided by the signal handler are the direct key material
//! that should be used with the application's key derivation function.
//!
