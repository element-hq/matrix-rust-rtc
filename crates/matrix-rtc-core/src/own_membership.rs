//! Own membership management for RTC sessions.
//!
//! This module provides the `OwnMembershipMachine` that manages the lifecycle of the
//! current user's own membership in an RTC session, including the dead man's switch
//! keep-alive mechanism.
//!
//! The dead man's switch strategy works as follows:
//! 1. **Schedule delayed leave FIRST** - This is the safety net. If the client dies at any
//!    point, the delayed leave will fire and clean up our membership.
//! 2. **Send join membership** - Send the sticky join event to announce our presence.
//! 3. **Heartbeat** - Periodically restart the delayed leave to extend the timeout.
//!
//! This ensures that if the client crashes or loses connection, the delayed leave will
//! automatically clean up after the timeout period, preventing ghost memberships.
//!
//! # Two clocks, one heartbeat
//!
//! Our membership expires in two independent ways, and
//! [`OwnMembershipMachine::heartbeat`] has to tend both:
//!
//! - The **delayed leave** (`keep_alive_timeout_ms`, seconds) is the dead man's
//!   switch above. Its timer is pushed back out on every heartbeat via MSC4140's
//!   `restart` action — never cancel-and-recreate, which leaves a window with
//!   nothing armed and can leak a delay that then marks us departed mid-call.
//! - The **sticky-map entry** (`sticky_duration_ms`, an hour by default) is how
//!   long the homeserver keeps the membership at all. Re-sent once it is
//!   halfway to expiry.
//!
//! Tending only the first produces a membership that vanishes mid-call with a
//! perfectly healthy heartbeat; tending only the second leaves a ghost
//! membership behind when the client dies. A host that never calls `heartbeat`
//! gets both failures.
//!
//! # When the homeserver has no delayed events
//!
//! MSC4140 is optional and plenty of homeservers refuse it — matrix.org answers
//! `403 M_FORBIDDEN "Sending delayed events has been disallowed"`. Only the first
//! of the two clocks is lost there, so the call is perfectly joinable: the
//! membership still expires on its own, just on the slower schedule. The machine
//! therefore degrades rather than failing the join, and publishes on
//! [`crate::join::DEFAULT_DEGRADED_LIFETIME_MS`] so a crashed client is forgotten
//! in minutes rather than in an hour. See [`DelayedLeaveSupport`].
//!
//! That choice is made **before the first membership goes out** and never
//! revisited, because a sticky entry cannot be shortened afterwards: MSC4354
//! keeps whichever event expires last, so a refresh carrying a shorter duration
//! loses to the entry already in the map. It is only expressible at all because
//! the delayed leave is armed one step earlier than the membership.
