Browser-first JavaScript bindings for `matrix-rtc-wasm`.

This package is a thin packaging layer around the Rust wasm crate in `crates/matrix-rtc-wasm`. It uses `wasm-pack` to generate runtime bindings into `web/pkg/`, which stays uncommitted.

For what the binding *is* and how to integrate it — the Matrix host contract, sync feeding, keys, Element Call compatibility, and a get-started sample — see `crates/matrix-rtc-wasm/README.md`. The complete working reference is `web/demo/`.

## Package shape

- `pkg/browser/`: browser-first wasm-pack output built with `--target web`
- `pkg/node/`: Node.js fallback output built with `--target nodejs`
- `src/`: the shipped integration layers — `MatrixRtcCall` (export `./call`,
  the livekit-client half) and `MatrixHost`/`createMatrixSession` (export
  `./matrix-js-sdk-host`, the Matrix half); each dependency is an optional,
  injected peer
- `test/`: JavaScript smoke tests for package exports and generated bindings

## The call model (`./call`)

`MatrixRtcCall` composes a joined `WasmRtcCall` with
`livekit-client` (an optional peer dependency, injected — so it is also
mockable):

```js
import { MatrixRtcCall } from 'matrix-rtc-wasm/call';
import * as livekit from 'livekit-client';

const call = new MatrixRtcCall({
  call: rtcCall,           // what `rtcRoom.joinCall(...)` returned
  livekit,
  roomOptions: { e2ee: { worker: e2eeWorker } }, // omit to run without frame E2EE
});
call.onParticipants = (roster) => render(roster);
await call.connect({ userId, deviceId, livekitServiceUrl });
```

Every roster entry is the Rust participant (`member_id`, `user_id`,
`is_local`, `reachable`, `streams`, `rtc_identity`) plus
`livekitParticipant` — the live livekit-js participant, joined by
`rtc_identity`. Rust owns the roster/pool/identity/key logic (the same
engine the mobile bindings run); this wrapper owns `fetch`, the livekit-js
rooms and the RoomEvent translation. The call keeps its own membership
alive; the page ticks nothing.

Media stays entirely in livekit-js: publish, subscribe, and render through
`livekitParticipant` / the `Room` as usual.

## Build

```bash
cd web
npm run build
```

That runs:

1. `wasm-pack build ../crates/matrix-rtc-wasm --target web`
2. `wasm-pack build ../crates/matrix-rtc-wasm --target nodejs`

## Test

```bash
cd web
npm run test:vitest
```

The tests are written to skip the runtime smoke check if `pkg/` has not been generated yet.

## Notes

- Generated files are intentionally not committed.
- The package export map favors browser usage by default.
- If you want a published npm name later, a scoped name like `@matrix-org/matrix-rtc-wasm` would be a natural fit.
