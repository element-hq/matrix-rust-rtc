# Agent Context: Matrix RTC Rust

## Project Overview

This project is a Rust implementation of a Matrix RTC (Real-Time Communication) client. 
It is designed to facilitate real-time communication features such as voice and video calls within the Matrix ecosystem.

The idea is to provide a core RTC SDK in Rust that can be used across multiple platforms, with bindings
for web (via WebAssembly) and native mobile platforms (via FFI).
This allows us to maintain a single codebase for the core RTC functionality while enabling broad platform support.

At the higher level, the rtc-sdk is fed events from the Matrix client (e.g., incoming call, call state changes)
and provides an API for managing RTC sessions, like membership management, call control.
The rtc-sdk will itself send commands back to the Matrix client to perform actions like accepting/declining a call,
updating call state, sending reactions, raising hand, handling key distribution for E2EE calls, etc.

The project provides clean interfaces for the Matrix client to interact with the RTC functionality, while abstracting away platform-specific details.
It can then be used in web in conjunction with the matrix-js-sdk and in mobile with the matrix-rust-sdk bindings.

// TODO flesh out the architecture and design principles more in the ARCHITECTURE.md, but the high-level idea is:
- The core rtc-sdk is implemented in Rust, providing the main logic and state management for RTC sessions.
- For web, we compile the Rust code to WebAssembly and provide JavaScript bindings for easy integration with the matrix-js-sdk.
- For native mobile platforms, we provide FFI bindings that can be used in the matrix-rust-sdk to integrate RTC functionality into iOS and Android apps.
All organized in a rust workspace with clear boundaries between the core logic and platform-specific bindings.
There will also be a crate to manage the livekit transport integration (MSC4195), using the rust livekit client library, that
can be used to record calls via a headless bot


## Audience & Scope
This document is a lightweight guide for contributors and automated agents. It focuses on stable concepts and boundaries, not implementation details.

## First-Pass Handoff (for Agents)

After implementing a requested change, stop and hand the result to the user before doing the full code-quality pass.

- Default workflow: implement the change, do only the narrowest sanity check needed to avoid an obviously broken handoff, then ask whether the user is happy with the result.
- Run only the narrow sanity checks needed before handoff; run full build/coverage/benchmark/broad suites after direction is confirmed.
- Add follow-up work (wider refactors, extra tests, documentation polish) after the user confirms direction or explicitly asks for the quality pass.
- If a validation step is needed before user feedback, keep it targeted to the touched code and state why that check is necessary.
- Once the user confirms the direction, complete the remaining quality work needed for the requested end state.

Commit after the first implementation handoff cycle: write the code, show what changed, gather feedback, then commit once the user confirms direction (or explicitly asks for a commit).

## Development Phase

This project is in active development.

- Source and API/ABI breaking changes are acceptable for now.
- Prioritize clarity and fast iteration over backward compatibility.
- Prefer direct renames/removals instead of compatibility shims unless explicitly requested.

## Tech Stack (High-Level)
- Rust for core rtc sdk
- Wasm for web bindings
- FFI bindings for native integration (mobile)

## Repository Layout (Intent-Oriented)

## Useful Commands

- `cargo check`
- `cargo fmt`
- `make clippy` (explicit features; `--all-features` turns on `experimental-sticky`, which needs the fork SDK — see `make clippy-sticky`)
- `cargo test`
- Web bindings: `cd web && npm run build && npm test`
- Android bindings: `./scripts/build-android-aar.sh`
- iOS bindings (macOS): `./scripts/build-ios-xcframework.sh`

## Pre-Commit Checklist (for Agents)

Use this checklist for commit/PR readiness after the initial implementation handoff.

Before committing **any** code change (new feature, bug fix, PR comment fix, refactor, etc.), always run the following commands and resolve all errors before proceeding:

`cargo check`
`cargo fmt`
`make clippy` (explicit features; `--all-features` turns on `experimental-sticky`, which needs the fork SDK — see `make clippy-sticky`)
`cargo test`

Then run binding tasks for any touched binding surface:

- If changes touch `crates/matrix-rtc-wasm/**` or `web/**`:
  - `cd web && npm run build`
  - `cd web && npm test`
- If changes touch `crates/matrix-rtc-ffi/**`, `mobile/**`, or `scripts/build-*.sh`:
  - `./scripts/build-android-aar.sh`
  - `./scripts/build-ios-xcframework.sh` (on macOS)

If a required platform/toolchain is not available locally, document the skip reason in the PR description and ensure the corresponding CI job passes before merge.

Commit only after every checklist step passes; fix failures and re-run the full checklist until green.

**Manual review** — before committing, scan the diff against each pillar in [Code Quality Standards](#code-quality-standards) and verify all apply.


## Contribution Guidelines
- Always pass the full [Pre-Commit Checklist](#pre-commit-checklist-for-agents), including binding build/test tasks for touched binding surfaces, before committing.

## Changelog, Commit Messages and PR Descriptions

Keep them to about one line. A user-visible change gets a `CHANGELOG.md` entry
under `## Unreleased` in the matching subsection (`Added`, `Fixed`, `Breaking`,
...): one sentence naming the change, with the issue number.

- Good: `Our own publications now land on the roster when they are made before our membership does, mute state included (#50).`
- Do not imitate the long bold-lede-plus-paragraphs entries already in
  `CHANGELOG.md` — that is legacy style, not a target.

Reasoning and detail belong in code comments and the issue, not in the
changelog, the commit body or the PR description.

## Comments and Module Documentation

- Add a short module-level rustdoc comment (`//!`) in each new Rust module and in modified modules when missing.
- Module comments should explain intent and boundaries, not line-by-line behavior.
- For boundary/transport modules, explicitly mention DTO rationale: DTOs are used to decouple core logic from platform-specific SDK or FFI types.
- Keep comments concise (2-6 lines is usually enough), factual, and maintenance-friendly.
