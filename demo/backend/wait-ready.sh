# Host-side readiness probe for the MatrixRTC backend stack. `docker compose up
# --wait` already gates on the synapse and livekit healthchecks; this exists
# mainly for lk-jwt-service, whose FROM-scratch image cannot carry a compose
# healthcheck (no shell, and 0.4.4 predates the healthcheck binary).
# With --interop it additionally probes the TLS overlay
# (docker-compose.interop.yml): the proxied homeserver, the MatrixRTC origin,
# Element Web, and the Element Call widget Element Web bundles.
