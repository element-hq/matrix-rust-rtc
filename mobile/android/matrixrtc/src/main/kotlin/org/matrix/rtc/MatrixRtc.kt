/**
 * Loads the SDK's native library. **Call [initialize] once before any other
 * SDK call** — including the generated `org.matrix.rtc.*` API.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * MatrixRtc.initialize()
 * RtcLogging.initLogcat()
 * ```
 *
 * ### Why this is not automatic
 *
 * The generated bindings reach the native library through JNA
 * (`Native.load`), which resolves it with `dlopen`. `dlopen` does **not**
 * invoke `JNI_OnLoad` — only ART's `System.loadLibrary` does. In the media
 * build `JNI_OnLoad` is what hands libwebrtc the `JavaVM` and class loader it
 * needs before a `PeerConnectionFactory` can exist, so on a JNA-only load the
 * first attempt to open a session aborts the process (SIGABRT from inside
 * libwebrtc's JNI helpers, not a catchable exception).
 *
 * Doing this from a `ContentProvider` or `androidx.startup` initializer would
 * make it invisible to callers, but it would also map the library — 20 MB-plus
 * in the media variant — into every process at launch, whether or not the app
 * ever places a call. Loading is therefore the host's call, and this method is
 * the whole of it: no [android.content.Context], no configuration.
 *
 * Idempotent and thread-safe; extra calls are no-ops.

     * @throws UnsatisfiedLinkError if the native library is missing from the

    /**
     * Keeps every native thread that calls back into Kotlin attached to the
     * JVM for the life of the thread, rather than for the life of one call.
     *
     * Without this, JNA attaches a thread on its first callback and calls
     * `DetachCurrentThread` as soon as that callback returns. libwebrtc caches a
     * `JNIEnv*` in a pthread key (`g_jni_ptr`) for every thread *it* attaches
     * and detaches only from that key's destructor, so a JNA detach on a shared
     * thread leaves the cached pointer behind with no attachment under it. The
     * next `AttachCurrentThreadIfNeeded` on that thread fails
     * `RTC_CHECK(!pthread_getspecific(g_jni_ptr))` — "TLS has a JNIEnv* but not
     * attached?" — and aborts the process.
     *
     * The two libraries do share threads: uniffi wakes a Rust future by
     * invoking the continuation callback inline on whichever thread completed
     * the work, which for a video frame is libwebrtc's own decode thread. That
     * makes the collision one JNA callback per delivered frame.
     *
     * `detach = false` is what fixes it. The name is a diagnostic bonus: a JNA
     * attach passes none, so the JVM assigns `Thread-<n>` from a process-wide
     * counter and pushes it down to the thread's `comm`, which is why a
     * tombstone from one of these threads names it `Thread-10694` and why
     * `ps -T` appears to show thousands of short-lived threads.
     *
     * Costs one JVM thread peer per native thread that ever runs a callback —
     * libwebrtc's pool plus our Tokio workers, created once.
     *
     * Must run before anything hands these callbacks to Rust, i.e. before
     * `UniffiLib.INSTANCE` is first touched.
